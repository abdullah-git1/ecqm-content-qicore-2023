Long-term therapy with ARBs have also been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality, especially in ACE inhibitor–intolerant patients. More recently, ARNI therapy has also been shown to more significantly improve outcomes, such that the newest guidelines recommend replacement of ACE inhibitors or ARBs with ARNI therapy in eligible patients. However, despite the benefits of these drugs, use of ACE inhibitor, ARB, or ARNI remains suboptimal.","clinicalRecommendationStatement":"The clinical strategy of inhibition of the renin angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors (Class 1, Level of Evidence: A), OR ARBs (Class 1, Level of Evidence: A), OR ARNI (Class 1, Level of Evidence: B-R) in conjunction with evidence-based beta blockers, and aldosterone antagonists in selected patients, is recommended for patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) to reduce morbidity and mortality (ACC/AHA/HFSA, 2017).\n\nThe use of ACE inhibitors is beneficial for patients with prior or current symptoms of chronic HFrEF to reduce morbidity and mortality (Class I, Level of Evidence A) (ACC/AHA/HFSA, 2017).\n\nTreatment with an ACE inhibitor should be initiated at low doses [see excerpt from guideline table below], followed by gradual dose increments if lower doses have been well tolerated... Clinicians should attempt to use doses that have been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in clinical trials. If these target doses of an ACE inhibitor cannot be used or are poorly tolerated, intermediate doses should be used with the expectation that there are likely to be only small differences in efficacy between low and high doses. Abrupt withdrawal of treatment with an ACE inhibitor can lead to clinical deterioration and should be avoided (ACCF/AHA, 2013).\n\nDrugs Commonly Used for Stage C HFrEF (abbreviated to align with focus of measure to include only ACE inhibitors,  ARB and ARNI therapy)\n\nDrug\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Initial Daily Dose(s)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Maximum Dose(s)\t\t\t Mean Doses Achieved in \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tClinical Trials\n\tACE Inhibitors\n\t\t Captopril\t\t\t\t\t\t\t6.25 mg 3 times\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t 50 mg 3 times\t\t\t\t\t\t\t122.7 mg/d\n\t\t Enalapril\t\t\t\t\t\t\t 2.5 mg twice\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t10 to 20 mg twice\t\t\t\t16.6 mg/d\n\t\t Fosinopril\t\t\t\t\t\t 5 to 10 mg once\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t 40 mg once\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tN/A\n\t\t Lisinopril\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2.5 to 5 mg once\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t20 to 40 mg once\t\t\t\t 32.5 to 35.0 mg/d\t\n\t\t Perindopril\t\t\t\t\t 2 mg once\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t8 to 16 mg once\t\t\t\t\t N/A\n\t\t Quinapril\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5 mg twice\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t 20 mg twice\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tN/A\n\t\t Ramipril\t\t\t\t\t\t\t 1.25 to 2.5 mg once\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t 10 mg once\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tN/A\n\t\t Trandolapril\t\t\t\t\t1 mg once\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4 mg once\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t N/A\n\tAngiotensin Receptor Blockers\n\t\t Candesartan\t\t\t\t 4 to 8 mg once\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t32 mg once\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t24 mg/d\n\t\t Losartan\t\t\t\t\t\t\t 25 to 50 mg once\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t 50 to 150 mg once\t\t\t129 mg/d\n\t\t Valsartan\t\t\t\t\t\t\t20 to 40 mg twice\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t 160 mg twice\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t 254 mg/d\n\tARNI\n\t\t Sacubitril/\t\t\t\t\t\t 49/51 mg twice (sacubitril\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t97/103 mg twice\t\t\t\t\t375 mg/d; target dose:\n\t\t valsartan\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvalsartan) (therapy may be\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(sacubitril/\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t24/26 mg, 49/51 mg OR\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinitiated at 24/26 mg twice)\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvalsartan)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t97/103 mg twice\n\t\n\nThe use of ARBs to reduce morbidity and mortality is recommended in patients with current or prior symptoms of chronic HFrEF who are intolerant to ACE inhibitors because of cough or angioedema (Class I, Level of Evidence A) (ACC/AHA/HFSA, 2017).\n\nARBs are reasonable to reduce morbidity and mortality as alternatives to ACE inhibitors as first-line therapy for patients with HFrEF, especially for patients already taking ARBs for other indications, unless contraindicated (Class IIa, Level of Evidence: A) (ACCF/AHA, 2013).\n\nAddition of an ARB may be considered in persistently symptomatic patients with HFrEF who are already being treated with an ACE inhibitor and a beta blocker in whom an aldosterone antagonist is not indicated or tolerated (Class IIb, Level of Evidence: A) (ACCF/AHA, 2013).\n\nThe clinical strategy of inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors (Level of Evidence A), or ARBs (Level of Evidence A) or ARNI (Level of Evidence B-R) in conjunction with evidence-based beta-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists in selected patients, is recommended for patients with chronic HFrEF to reduce morbidity and mortality (Class I) (ACC/AHA/HFSA, 2017).\n\nIn patients with chronic symptomatic HFrEF New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or III who tolerate an ACE inhibitor or ARB, replacement by an ARNI is recommended to further reduce morbidity and mortality (Class I, Level of Evidence: B-R) (ACC/AHA/HFSA, 2017).\n\nARNI should not be administered concomitantly with ACE inhibitors or within 36 hours of the last dose of an ACE inhibitor (Class III, Level of Evidence B-R) (ACC/AHA/HFSA, 2017).\n\nARNI should not be administered to patients with a history of angioedema (Class III Recommendation, Level of Evidence C-EO) (ACC/AHA/HFSA, 2017).","improvementNotation":{"coding":[{"system":"http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/measure-improvement-notation","code":"increase"}]},"guidance":"This eCQM is to be reported as patient-based.
