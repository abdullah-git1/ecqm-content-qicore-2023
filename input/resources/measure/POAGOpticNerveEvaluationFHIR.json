In 2011, 2.71 million persons in the U.S. had primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and in 2050, an estimated 7.32 million persons will have POAG (Vajaranant, Wu, Torres, & Varma, 2012). Furthermore, a study by Rein, Zhang, & Wirth (2006) estimated that the total financial burden of major visual disorders among U.S. residents aged 40 years or older was $35.4 billion in 2004: $16.2 billion in direct medical costs, $11.1 billion in other direct costs, and $8 billion in productivity losses. Of the direct medical costs, approximately $2.9 billion was attributable to glaucoma (Rein, Zhang, & Wirth, 2006). It is imperative that evidence-based care be delivered to all glaucoma patients. \n\nAccording to recent guidelines, optic nerve changes are one of the characteristics which reflect progression of glaucoma (the other characteristic is visual field). Examination of the optic nerve head (ONH) and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) provides valuable structural information about optic nerve damage from glaucoma. Visible structural alterations of the ONH or RNFL may precede the onset of visual field defects. Careful study of the optic disc neural rim for small hemorrhages is important because these hemorrhages sometimes signal focal disc damage and visual field loss, and they may signify ongoing optic nerve damage in patients with glaucoma (American Academy of Ophthalmology, 2015). Despite evidence emphasizing the value of an optic nerve evaluation, there is a gap in documentation patterns of the optic nerve for both initial and follow-up care.\n\nThis measure is intended to promote examination and documentation of the structure and function of the optic nerve, and to monitor and detect disease progression among patients diagnosed with POAG.","clinicalRecommendationStatement":"Ophthalmic Evaluation\nThe ophthalmic evaluation specifically focuses on the following elements in the comprehensive adult medical eye evaluation:\n\nVisual acuity measurement\nPupil examination\nAnterior segment examination\nIOP measurement\nGonioscopy\nOptic nerve head (ONH) and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) examination\nFundus examination\n(American Academy of Ophthalmology, 2015)\n\nThe optic nerve should be carefully examined for the signs of glaucoma damage, and its appearance should be serially documented (I+, moderate quality, strong recommendation) (American Academy of Ophthalmology, 2015).","improvementNotation":{"coding":[{"system":"http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/measure-improvement-notation","code":"increase"}]},"guidance":"Optic nerve head evaluation includes examination of the cup to disc ratio and identification of optic disc or retinal nerve abnormalities. Both of these components of the optic nerve head evaluation are examined using ophthalmoscopy.\n\nThe measure, as written, does not specifically require documentation of laterality. Coding limitations in particular clinical terminologies do not currently allow for that level of specificity (ICD-10-CM includes laterality, but SNOMED-CT does not uniformly include this distinction). Therefore, at this time, it is not a requirement of this measure to indicate laterality of the diagnoses, findings or procedures. Available coding to capture the data elements specified in this measure has been provided. It is assumed that the eligible professional or eligible clinician will record laterality in the patient medical record, as quality care and clinical documentation should include laterality.\n\nThis eCQM is a patient-based measure.\n\nTelehealth encounters are not eligible for this measure because the measure requires a clinical action that cannot be conducted via telehealth.\n\nThis version of the eCQM uses QDM version 5.6.
